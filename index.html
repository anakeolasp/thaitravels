<h1 class="links-sb"><img class="artist-gallery" src="aksp.jpg" alt="Ana Keola SP founder profile image"></h1>
      <p>Hi Travelers, my name is Ana! I am the founder and sole advisor of Ana Keola SP.</p>
<hr>
<p>As an independent travel advisor serving the regions of Pattaya and Bangkok in Thailand, my responsibility is to make your day happen with effortless convenience, allowing you the privilege to relax and live with ease, comfort, and confidence. In addition to my fluency in English and cultural familiarity for Thailand, I have over 8 years of experience providing professional services to people in various hospitality and customer-oriented industries. I was an independent massage therapist for nearly 4 years with professional affiliation on online marketplaces and networks such as Soothe, Zeel, Thumbtack, and the American Massage Therapy Association. After wanting a career change, I spent the following three years attempting to pursue a career in music as a producer. The music plan failed miserably and nearly destroyed my faith of wanting to create anything again. Luckily, life happens in a good way.</p>
<hr>
<p>The idea and motivation for starting my business began after I met a young entreprenuer on the bus from Bangkok to Pattaya. I had no idea that this man would be so brilliant, kind, generous, wise, and inspirational. We had fun talking to each other and agreed to spend time together. From being with him, I gained valuable business insight, inspiration, motivation, and memorable life experiences. On his last day in Pattaya, we parted in the mid afternoon on a beautiful rooftop. I closed my eyes, smiled, and expressed gratitude for everything that this man had given to me. The next day, I took the train back to Bangkok and woke up with a new perspective. I wanted to create a business that involved my love for Thai culture and my appreciation for traveling while utilizing my years of professional experience.</p>
<hr>
<p>Thank you for visiting my website. I hope that I have inspired you to make an appointment with me for your next trip to Bangkok or Pattaya! Don't forget to check out my latest videos on Instagram! See you soon! </p>
